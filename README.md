# Bambufy AD5X
 - Compatible with Bambu Studio, better management of the prime tower
   ([3MF](https://github.com/function3d/zmod_ff5x/raw/refs/heads/1.6/PinkyWings_FireDragon.3mf))
  - Purge sequences fully controlled by Bambu Studio (same behavior as
   Bambu Lab printers)
   - Accurate time and material usage estimates
   - 24 mm retraction before filament cut on every color change (saves ~7
   meters of filament across 300 color changes)
   - Reduced purge multiplier (≈ 0.7) possible without color mixing in
   most prints
   - “Flush into object infill” and “flush into object supports”
   effectively reduce filament waste
   - **Material-to-waste ratio rarely exceeds 50%, even on 4-color prints**
   - **Mainsail displays true colors directly from the slicer**
   - **45 seconds color change time**
   - Bed leveling before print (Level On/Off)
   - External spool printing (IFS On/Off)
   - Backup printing mode – up to 4 kg of uninterrupted printing (Backup
   On/Off)
  - Automatic fallback when IFS runs out: the remaining filament in the
   printhead is used until the next color change
   - Filament state detection at print_start to identify the active
   filament in the extruder
   - Detection of jams, breaks, or filament runout
   - Improved routine for automatic print recovery after power outages or
   errors
